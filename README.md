# BetterBatch
A transpiler for batch files to overcome the limitations of the Batch scripting language.
## Why?
Batch has been limited by many things ever since its creation. This changes that.
## How to build the compiler from source
#### NOTE: This is not needed if you just want to use BetterBatch.
Install nexe using `npm i -g nexe`.

Run `nexe main --build -o bbsc.exe`.

Ya done kid.
